While considerable research has been conducted on Sudoku already, only little exists on Str8ts. A Google Scholar search on 01.07.2025 for "sudoku algorithm" yielded about 13.300 results, while one for "str8ts algorithm" returned 9. A short skim showed that, out of these, zero actually included an algorithm~\cite{website-str8ts, jilg2009sudoku, cameron2007sudoku, website-scholar}.

A search on GitHub, the largest code hosting platform, yields similar findings. Again, approximately 40,000 results for "sudoku solver" but only 23 for "str8ts solver." Figure~\ref{fig:github-languages} shows the exact programming language distribution with these 23 repositories spanning 10 different programming languages. Out of these, Haskell was the most common, appearing in 5 repositories (21.7\%).

However, these results cannot be used to assess popularity, as they are skewed. All five Haskell repositories, see Table \ref{tab:haskell-repositories}, appear to be assignments from the State University of Santa Catarina (UDESC). Four of these are bilingual (English and Portuguese) and one is English-only. Similar last update times suggest two courses with shared deadlines. \textit{alanludke}, \textit{SatoshiKei}, and \textit{EnzoAlbornoz} form one group. \textit{andrefpf} and \textit{jeanlopoldo} the other.

Some repositories also include artifacts linking directly to the university. For instance, \textit{alanludke}'s repository contains \textit{Trabalho I.pdf}, likely the original assignment document. A DeepL translation reveals that the task was to solve Str8ts or Renban using backtracking, starting with $6\times 6$ grids without concern for efficiency~\cite{website-renban, website-deepl}.
