We apply \textit{equational reasoning} -- a core principle of functional programming -- to design a Str8ts solver. Despite its similarities to Sudoku, there is little research on this puzzle. A Google Scholar search, for instance, returns only 8 results for "str8ts solver", all of them false positives. We follow the approach outlined in Bird’s \textit{A Simple Sudoku Solver}. We first develop a basic solver, $simpleSolve$, and systematically refine it into an efficient version, $advancedSolve$. To benchmark performance, we introduce practical modules -- $PuzzleDownloader$, $PuzzleScraper$, and $RuntimeAnalyser$. The source code is available in our GitHub repository, \href{https://github.com/e11720061/a-simple-str8ts-solver}{a-simple-str8ts-solver}, and can be used to test other solutions. Running $advancedSolve$ on 365 puzzles from 2023, we establish a reproducible baseline for future research. Our algorithm was able to solve all puzzles with an average run-time of 504.08, a minimum of 3.50, and a maximum of 14359.28 milliseconds.
