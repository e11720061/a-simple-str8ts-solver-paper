We apply \textit{equational reasoning}, a core principle of functional programming, to design a Str8ts solver. Despite its similarities to Sudoku, research on this puzzle is scarce. A Google Scholar search for "str8ts solver" returns only eight results, all false positives. We follow the approach outlined in Bird’s \textit{A Simple Sudoku Solver}. First, we develop a basic solver, $simpleSolve$. Then, we systematically refine it into a more efficient solver, $advancedSolve$. By leveraging structural similarities between Str8ts and Sudoku, we are able to reuse Bird's transformation steps directly. We present our work as suggested in \textit{How To Write A Functional Pearl}.

To benchmark performance, we set up a Haskell project and introduced practical modules, $PuzzleDownloader$ and $RuntimeAnalyser$. The source code is available in our GitHub repository, \href{https://github.com/e11720061/a-simple-str8ts-solver/tree/main/project}{a-simple-str8ts-solver/project}
, and can be used to test other solutions. We chose 365 puzzles from the official website, \href{https://www.str8ts.com/}{www.str8ts.com}
, published between 01.01.2023 and 31.12.2023. Running $advancedSolve$ on these puzzles on a 16-inch MacBook Pro 2023 with an M3 Max chip establishes a reproducible baseline for future research. Our algorithm solved all puzzles with an average run time of 504.1 ms, a minimum of 3.5 ms, and a maximum of 14,359.3 ms (= 14.3593 s). Results are rounded to one decimal place.
