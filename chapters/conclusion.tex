\chapter{Conclusion}\label{chap:conclusion}

% Unlike Sudoku, Str8ts has received little academic attention. We found no algorithmic discussions on Google Scholar. This paper aims to fill that gap. We build on an idea from Bird’s A Simple Solver -- using equational reasoning to design algorithms.
% We first present a simple but clearly correct solver: $simpleSolve$. Then, using many of Bird’s proofs, we transform it into a more efficient version: $advancedSolve$.

% To support our analysis, we developed several tools.
% For example, the $PuzzleScraper$ module downloads puzzles from the official website.
% The $RuntimeAnalyser$ module measures runtime and exports the results as $.csv$. We tested $advancedSolve$ on 365 puzzles published between 01/01/2023 and 31/12/2023. It solved all puzzles correctly, matching the official solutions.
% This runtime data can serve as a baseline for comparing future algorithms.

% The full source code is available on GitHub.
% Our framework allows others to implement and evaluate alternative solvers. Future work could compare different approaches, both quantitatively and qualitatively, to assess the value of equational reasoning.
